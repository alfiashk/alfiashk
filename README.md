## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I'm a Computer Science graduate with a strong academic background (9.5 CGPA) and a passion for building web applications that solve real-world problems.

💻 I work mainly with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and have deployed multiple full-stack projects using **Render**, **Cloudinary**, and **MongoDB Atlas**.

🔍 I'm currently looking for **internships or entry-level roles** in full-stack or backend development where I can learn, contribute, and grow.
